# Object Detection

# Overview
This project focuses on developing an object detection system that utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to accurately identify and localize objects within images or video streams, providing bounding boxes and class labels for each detected object.

# Features
1: Multiple Object Recognition: Identifies and classifies multiple objects simultaneously
2: Custom Model Training: Supports training on custom datasets to tailor detection capabilities
3: Integration with PyTorch: Built using the PyTorch framework for flexibility and performance
